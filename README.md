A quick demo of the capabilities of AR for Frank.

Visiting the app and then pointing the camera towards the painting located in Hendon, Sunderland should make butterlfies appear on screen.

This can be tested without visiting the site b pointing the camera at the photo of the real painting on his website:


On your Mobile:
